%Our design aimed at simulating the network environment of a campus network with a minimum number of equipments.
%On the point of connection function,all of our inside hosts can visit the Internet.What'more,the server is open to
%both the intranet and the outer network.In terms of security ,what we have already relized is the isolation between
%different departments but interoperability,isolation of teaching and non teaching areas.AS  for IP allocation,
%the server is allocated in a static IP, and the other terminals are allocated with dynamic IP.Also,there are three services:campus web site,file sharing and internal network DNS.
